A series of short animated loops and visuals to accompany a live performance directed by Sunil Shanbagh and [Tamasha Theatre](http://www.tamaashatheatre.com/wordhavebeen.html). The piece was around dissent on caste, gender, the relationship between the individual and the state, and language, from India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, the USA, Palestine and Iraq. 

This animated video on Landays, a poetry form by Afghan women was one of several videos that I made for this performance.
