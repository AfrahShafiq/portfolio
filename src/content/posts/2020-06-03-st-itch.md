st.itch is multimedia patchwork that looks at the transgressive potential of women’s domestic labor and its connection to cybernetics and code.

Drawn in by an endless supply of images in the archives in the north of England of women sitting indoors, quietly, head bent, fingers busy, often alone - lost in what is being created with their hands, st.itch explores where the mind travels to when the body is engaged in repetitive/ endless/ invisible/ mechanised labour.

While women spent hours on end cutting vegetables, washing clothes, doing the dishes and sewing stitch after stitch, weaving knit after knit in their “free” time – the mind enters a deep daydream. What effects do mechanical labor have on the mind, and what are the connections between women’s domestic labor – programming – cybernetics and code? 

While abiding by a certain conduct have women also been living in code? Is there a glitch in the system to slip through the cracks of the physical realm? Can we decode this system through the archive?
