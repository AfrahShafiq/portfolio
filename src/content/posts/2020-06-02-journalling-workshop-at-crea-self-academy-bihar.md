Conducted a three day workshop at [CREA's SELF ACADEMY](https://www.creaworld.org/events/crea-organises-its-first-self-academy-sports-empowerment-leadership-and-freedom-young-girls) in Patna with a group of fifty adolescent girls, where through the workshop we played with the journal as a space to explore your ideas around yourself, create images of your interior and physical life and make sense of them. 

These are some examples of what the participants made as the first journal entry introducing themselves.
