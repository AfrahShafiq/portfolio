A research film directed by Ridham Janve, commissioned by [SELCO FOUNDATION](http://www.selcofoundation.org/). 

There are two rivers in Bidar, but this is not enough for even basic drinking water supply. The community completely needs to rely on groundwater or rains for agriculture, but the rains have drastically thinned out over the past few years. This is a research documentary to understand the way sudden scant rainfall affects livelihoods, housing, agriculture, migration and finance.
