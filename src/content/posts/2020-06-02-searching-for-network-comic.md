Searching for Network is an Illustrated Web Story based on the research, stories and findings in a thesis on **'Lesbian and Bisexual Women in India and the Internet as a Safe Space to Socialise'** by **Smita Vaniyar** at Tata Institute of Social Sciences.  

I was commissioned to read the thesis and made a comic for a collection called Sexing the Interwebs, on [Deep Dives](https://deepdives.in/about) by Point of View. 

This piece was republished on The Ladies Finger and also printed in the closing edition of Scripts (the first lesbian zine that is also mentioned in the comic).

The first season of Deep Dives - Sexing the Interwebs that this piece was a part of, won the South Asian Laadli Media Award for Gender Sensitivity 2017 in the “Best web series/Special edition” category.
