**2013 | Director and Editor**

Dream Girls was made as response to the December 16, 2012 Delhi gang rape and the year that followed it. This film looks at the ways in which women navigate their lives and the ways in which they would like to live it. Their reality is full of protest, fear, vigor, paranoia, chances and victories. But women are also dreaming all the time, and what is it that they dream about?

This film was commissioned by Grist Media for Yahoo originals.
