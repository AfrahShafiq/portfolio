**2018 | DIRECTOR and EDITOR (India Segment)**

Displacement & Resilience: women Iive for a new day, is a feature length character driven documentary on the theme of the worldwide refugee crisis all over the world. The film is made up of segments directed by five women filmmakers from different countries. The India segment, which I directed and edited, portrayed the story of Namgyal Lhagyari, a Tibetan born and brought up in exile in Dharamshala, India. 

Get in touch for a private screener of the film.
