A research film directed by Ridham Janve, commissioned by [SELCO FOUNDATION](http://www.selcofoundation.org/). 

Gajapati District, a tribal district in Odisha, was hit by a cyclone with winds of up to 150km/h (93mph). Months later, although there were efforts of rehabilitation by NGOâ€™s and government programmes underway, the lives of the affected areas were far from stable. This research documentary aims to understand the situation on the ground, and how exactly life has been affected / is being rebuilt.
