Afrah Shafiq is a multi/new media artist based out of Goa, India. Using the process of research as an artistic playground, Afrah intertwines archival findings, history, memory, folklore and fantasy to create a speculative world born of remix culture.
Her work moves across various mediums drawing from the handmade language of
traditional folk forms and connecting them to the digital language of the Internet and video
games.

She has exhibited at the Lahore Biennial (2020); Kochi Muziris Biennale (2018), Anant Art Gallery (2020) and The Guild Art Gallery (2018) in India; Florida Digital Grafitti Festival
(2018), The Fusebox Festival in Texas and the Computer Space festival in Bulgaria.
She has been a research fellow at the Institute of Advance Studies in Nantes, France and attended
residencies at Fluent Collaborative in Austin and the Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art.
Her upcoming projects include a solo show at Gallery Kostka in Prague and a field research
residency by the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow around illustrated children's books from the soviet era. She is currently
developing two new interactive works around Mother Mary, Miracles and the Moon.
She also works as a teacher, illustrator, animator, video editor and producer on various
projects in the world of documentary film, visual arts and the internet.
